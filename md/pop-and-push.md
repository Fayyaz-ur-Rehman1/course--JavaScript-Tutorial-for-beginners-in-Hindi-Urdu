# POP() - AND - PUSH() METHOD
> first we talk about pop()

# Pop()

> if u want to delete last array item then u have to use pop() method 
example -> ["fayyaz","adanan","danish","ram"]
its so like this and if we add pop() method then its show like this
["fayyaz","adanan","danish"] ram was deleted becouse ve use pop() method 
so the pattern to write this in internal is 
```javascript
var a = ["fayyaz","danish","adnana","ayyaz"]
a.pop()
document.write(a)
```
---
# Push()
> push() is oposite brother of pop() becouse we use pop() for delete last value and we use push() for add something at the last 
so the pattern to write this in internal method 
```javascript
var a = ["fayyaz","danish","adnana","ayyaz"]
a.push("uzair")
document.write(a)
```
