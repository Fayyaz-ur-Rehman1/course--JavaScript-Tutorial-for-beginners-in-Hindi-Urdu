# SHIFT() AND UNSHIFT ARRAY METHOD
> these method are same as pop() and push()
becouse pop() remove something from last in array 
and push() add something in last so the patter is same 
but in this shift() remove something from first and unshift()
is add something at the fornt 
so the pattern to writethese method in internal is 

# Shift()
```javascript
var a = ["fayyaz","danish","adnana","ayyaz"]
a.shift()
document.write(a) 
```
# Unshift()
```javascript 
var a = ["fayyaz","danish","adnana","ayyaz"]
a.unshift("FAYYAZ")
document.write(a)
```
